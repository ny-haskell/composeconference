        <p>The audience for Compose is Haskell, OCaml, F#, or SML developers who are looking to increase their skills or learn new technologies and libraries. Presentations should be aimed at teaching or introducing new ideas or tools. We are also interested in presentations aiming at taking complex concepts, such as program derivation, and putting them into productive use. However proposals on anything that you suspect our audience may find interesting are welcome. The following are some of the types of talks we would welcome:</p>
        <p><b>Library/Tool Talks</b> — Exploring the uses of a powerful toolkit or library, be it for parsing, testing, data access and analysis, or anything else.</p>
        <p><b>Production Systems</b> — Experience reports on deploying functional techniques in real systems; insights revealed, mistakes made, lessons learned.</p>
        <p><b>Theory made Practical</b> — Just because it’s locked away in papers doesn’t mean it’s hard! Accessible lectures on classic results and why they matter to us today. Such talks can include simply introducing the principles of a field of research so as to help the audience read up on it in the future; from abstract machines to program derivation to branch-and-bound algorithms, the sky’s the limit.</p>
        <p>We also welcome proposals for more formal tutorials. Tutorials should be aimed at a smaller audience of beginner-to-novice understanding, and ideally include hands-on exercises.</p>
        <p>The due date for submissions is <b>December 14, 2015</b>. We will send out notice of acceptance by <b>December 24th</b>. We prefer that submissions be via the EasyChair website (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=compose2016">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=compose2016</a>). Please suggest a title, and describe the topic you intend to speak on. Talks can be either 30 or 45 minutes, please indicate how much time you would prefer to take.</p>

        <p>Additional information may be included on both your expertise and the interesting elements of your topic, going on what might be included in a public abstract. Furthermore, if your abstract doesn't feel "final"&mdash;don't worry! We'll work with you to polish it up.
        If you want to discuss your proposal(s) before submitting, or to further nail down what you intend to speak on, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@composeconference.org">info@composeconference.org</a>. We're happy to work with you, even if you are a new or inexperienced speaker, to help your talk be great.</p>
